## This video is about : 

Describe here what this video is about

## This video will teach the following things : 

* Introduction : You need to first watch the video about power supplies and stepper motor power input
* What is a stepper motor, how does it work
* What is a stepper motor driver, it controls a motor, smoothie controls it, you control smoothie with gcodes
* What is microstepping
* Wiring : How to correctly wire a stepper motor to the board ( pairs, and how to figure them out : datasheet, resistance, touching wires and rotating )
* There is a limit at 2A, if you need more, you need to use an external driver
* The voltage rating of the stepper motors is not important, provide 12 or 24v
* How to crimp
* Configuration : Which stepper motor driver output is which axis
* How to configure current in config, and how to figure out the right value
* How to calculate steps per mm
* How to setup the steps per mm
* How to setup the direction
* Testing : Configure and test one motor at a time
* Never connect or disconnect a motor while the power supply is powered on, it can kill the driver [ideally, demonstrate, we can send a board]
* How to test each motor
* What to do if it doesn't work

This video is not about : providing power to the stepper motor power input, this is covered in another video
