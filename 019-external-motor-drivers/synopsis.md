How to wire and use an external stepper motor driver

## This video will teach the following things : 

* You need to have watched the video about integrated stepper motor drivers first
* External drivers allow you to use beefier motors, or special ( 3-phase, servo ) motors
* Once everything is wired and configured correctly, using the external driver is the same as using the on-board one
* Drivers ( on-board and external ) are controlled via the step/dir interface
* How step/dir works
* Smoothieboard breaks out step/dir ( and allows any pin to be used )
* You can wire the external driver to the Smoothieboard and control it via step/dir
* You can do this either via positive signals, or via open-drain ( negative signals )
* External drivers also require external power input.
* How to wire a motor to the external driver
* External drivers need their microstepping and current to be set. Example.
