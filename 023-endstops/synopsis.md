## This video is about : 

In this video we learn what endstops are, and what we can use them for in Smoothie ( homing, and limit switches )

## This video will teach the following things : 

* An endstop is a mechanical switch that is put at an end of a given axis so we can detect when we are getting close to an end of a given axis
* Homing is telling Smoothie to go "seek" an endstop for an axis ( or all of them ). Once it is hit, we know where we are, before we didn't
* Limit switches is just using those same endstops to prevent the user from going out of bounds
* There are 6 endstop inputs : Two for each of the three axes.
* It is constituted of + and -, and a signal line ( that is read by Smoothie )
* Explain what is NC and NO, and what are pullups and pulldowns.
* Explain how to wire a NC endstop ( classical case )
* How to configure homing in the config file ( for a cartesian, simplest case )
* Testing your endstops ( M119 )
* Using the G28 command
* Enabling and testing limit switches ( demonstrate )
* Troubleshooting : use M119 to test, if false positives : use debounce, if stuck in place : reduce speeds
