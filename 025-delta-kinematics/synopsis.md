How to use Smoothie in a linear delta machine

## This video will teach the following things : 

* What is a linear delta machine, if you don't have one don't worry about this
* What is the difference between an axis and an actuator
* You must have configured the steps per mm for your actuator ( see stepper motor video )
* What other parameters must we figure out on a delta ( arm length and arm radius ) [show]
* How to measure them manually and change them in config
* What are endstops for on a linear delta ( top of towers )
* They need to either be mechanically perfectly positionned, or you need to use calibration for offsets
* You can use probes to do levelling and calibration, and on a delta you want to do that, see the videos
* What is gamma max and how to manually figure it out
* How to use M306/M206 to tune the Z position
* How to troubleshoot classic delta problems ( bad calibration, gamma max too high so head crashes into bed )
