## This video is about : 

Using a Solid State Relay instead of a Mosfet for temperaturecontrol or switching

## This video will teach the following things : 

* Before watching this video you must have watched the mosfets series, and the one about GPIO
* A Solid State relay is like a mosfet, but it can control higher loads, and some can control AC loads instead of DC ones
* A SSR is like a normal relay, but without the mechanical part and the noise
* Wiring : You need to use a GPIO pin ( any that is free ) to control the SSR [example]
* Show how to control an AC load [example] and how to control a DC load [example]
* Configuration for switch module : Show how to change a switch module to use a free pin
* Configuration for temperature control : same thing
* Temp control also means you need to reduce the pwm frequency, or use bang-bang, show examples ( SSRs generally want 20Hz max )
* Testing : How to test the SSR works independently of the Smoothieboard control by wiring +/- to 5V/gnd on the board
