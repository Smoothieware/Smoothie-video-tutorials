How to wire a laser diode to a smoothieboard, and how to use smoothie for laser control

## This video will teach the following things : 

* Intro : Lasers are dangerous, they can burn your eyes ( or your house ). Your eyes allow you to see, loosing them is very tragic.
* Always enclose lasers, people who don't are dumb. Make sure the laser can not turn on if the enclosure is open.
* Laser diodes are a bit like a lamp : you provide them with electrity and they provide light. Light that is very focused and if powerful enough can burn things.
* Wiring : You can not wire a laser diode directly to a smoothieboard or even use a mosfet to control it, you need a laser driver board
* You connect a power supply to the driver board, the diode to the laser board, and then use a control signal from the smoothieboard to modulate power [show]
* You need to use a PWM-capable pin, show which ones are
* Show how to use a switch to cut that signal ( for safety, enclosure all that )
* Things are very similar for CO2 laser power supplies, see the dedicated video
* Configuration : How to configure the laser module
* Testing : using G1 to test that the laser works correctly
* Usage : How the different gcodes work for laser, what software can be used for vector and raster
