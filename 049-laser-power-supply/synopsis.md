How to wire a CO2 laser power supply

## This video will teach the following things : 

* You must first watch the video on laser diodes because it explains most things about laser, this is just about what is specific to CO2
* Using a laser PSU is very similar to using a laser diode driver board, it's just bigger
* Wiring : All PSU are different but the basic principles of wiring them up are very similar
* Laser PSUs have two different inputs : one to turn the laser on and off ( TTL ) and one to modulate power ( PWM )
* You can either have TTL always active and use PWM to turn the laser on and off, or use a switch module to turn TTL on and off at beginning and end of jobs [show]
* How to wire PWM, how to use open-drain if needed
