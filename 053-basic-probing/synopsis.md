## This video is about : 

How to wire, configure and use a probe, only for basic probing ( no calibration yet )

## This video will teach the following things : 

* Introduction : A probe is a tool that tells Smoothieboard when it hits something. Smoothie moves it until it says it hit something, and then Smoothie knows where it is relative to what was hit
* This is useful to find a workpiece on a CNC, or for bed levelling and calibration on a 3D printer.
* Wiring : There are many types of probes, but they all mostly do the same thing : they are a switch, like the endstops at the end of axes.
* [examples we'll show here: gator-crip on endmill, and simple swith beside hotend]
* How to wire a probe : Should be NC ideally, look at endstops for more details
* Configuration : Configuring the zprobe module
* Testing : Test first with M119. Issue a G30, make sure you do so slowly, and make sure you can turn the printer off if something goes wrong
* Usage : You can specify a Z parameter to G30.
