How to use a probe to do three-point or grid levelling

## This video will teach the following things : 

* You must first watch the video about how to setup a probe
* Intro : Sometimes even if you try very hard things are not perfectly level or flat
* Levelling is the action of probing the bed, and use what we learned about the bed to compensate for any problems
* Three point levelling helps take a surface that is flat but not level, and compensate for it's tilt. 
* Grid helps you take a surface that is not flat, and compensate for the height differences
* Three point is generally used on cartesian 3D printers. Grid is used on cartesian and delta 3D printers, as well as for PCB milling. 
* The ability to save accross resets means you don't need a permanent probe, you can just attach it once, save and remove it for a long time
* Configuration : Show configuraton for each
* Usage : Show how to use each, show how to save accross resets
