How to make sure EMI and ground loop problems do not occur

## This video will teach the following things : 

* The board communicates with the computer and it's peripherals by using electrical signals
* Those are sent and received by sending a specific potential. If an electrical problem changes that, then a communication error can occur
* The symptoms of these sort of problems include : USB disconnects, board resets, ADC noise, Endstop noise, General wonkiness
* The reasons this is happening can include : 
* Your wires are antennae, they transform electromagnetic fields into electricity, this can cause interference. The more EM fields, the more interference. What can cause EM fields.
* Things are even worse if you have a ground loop, which is a huge antenna. Show a diagram of a ground loop.
* Variations in the power supply ( local Mains power, bad PSU ) can also cause problems
* Solutions : First off Ethernet does not have USB disconnects, so using thats is an easy shortcut to a working setup
* To prevent ground loops, use short power and USB cables, plug machine and computer into the same power strip
* Use USB cables with ferrite, shielded, short
* Add ferrite to other stuff [show]
* Twist wires, shield wires
* Remove interference sources [throw a microwave out a window]
* Clean up your power source
