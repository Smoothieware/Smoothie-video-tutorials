## Smoothie-video-tutorials

Synopses and data for the Smoothie series of tutorial videos.

The Smoothie project is planning, as part of the documentation effort, to try to get a series of tutorial videos produced.

In order for those videos to be shot, the text and all related information for them must be written. This is a repository for the community to contribute text and other assets.

HELP EXTREMELY WELCOME. REALLY. DO IT NOW
