## Smoothie-video-tutorials

The Smoothie project is planning, as part of the documentation effort, to try to get a series of tutorial videos produced.

In order for those videos to be shot, the text and all related information for them must be written. This is a repository for the community to contribute text and other assets.

HELP EXTREMELY WELCOME. REALLY. DO IT NOW

## The project

The goal is to create extremely-beginner-friendly tutorials. Imagine you knew nothing about Smoothie, and even about CNC in general.

You have never soldered anything, never wired cables, never even used a digital fabrication machine.

But you still want to build a Smoothie-powered mahine. What kind of videos would you like to watch ? This project is that video series.

However, the intent is not to keep it at the basics, but to also go into more advanced subjects, so that this is useful to as many people as possible.

After watching the series, one should be able to install and use a Smoothieboard in any kind of machine ( 3D printer, laser, CNC router ).

The videos will also be integrated into the text-based documentation ( smoothieware.org ), which is very complete, but can be a bit hard to digest.

## Youtube

The end goal is to finance Thomas Sanladerer ( https://www.patreon.com/toms3dp ) to produce the series. If you are potential sponsor of that work, don't hesitate to contact us.

Ideas for additional videos : 
* A tour of the different Smoothieboards and their peripherals/features
* A short explanation of Smoothie's internals
* A tour of various endstops and probes and how to use them all
* Using the ESP8826 ( once that is actually implemented )
* Connecting and using a CHIP or a Raspi
* Tour of the various extension boards
* How to protect a board with a fuse
